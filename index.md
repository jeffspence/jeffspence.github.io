hello!

i'm a phd student at uc berkeley in the
[computational biology graduate group](http://ccb.berkeley.edu)
advised by [yun s. song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/).


i have been working mainly on problems in population genetics but i am broadly
interested in the intersection of biology, statistics, and computation.
