hello!

i'm a postdoc at stanford in the
[department of genetics](https://www.med.stanford.edu/genetics.html)
working with
[jonathan pritchard](http://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html).

i received my ph.d. in
[computational biology](http://ccb.berkeley.edu)
from uc berkeley,
where i was advised by
[yun s. song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/).


i have been working mainly on problems in population genetics but i am broadly
interested in the intersection of biology, statistics, and computation.
