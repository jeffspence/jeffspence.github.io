<p style="font-size:40px">Hello and welcome to the Spence Group @ UCSF</p>
</center>
<br>

We work at the intersection of statistical genetics, population genetics,
and machine learning.

We develop methods and theory to understand how
evolution shapes the genetic architecture of complex traits at
different biological scales, but we are also broadly interested
in any biological puzzles that present interesting computational or
statistical challenges.

If you
are interested in joining us, we are always looking for enthusiastic
folks interested in quantitative work with any level of experience.

We are located on the beautiful Parnassus campus, minutes from
Mt. Sutro and Golden Gate Park, and situated between the vibrant
Inner Sunset and Cole Valley neighborhoods.
